Make an e-commerce website.
The website sells Products (name it however you want: beer, shoes etc). A product has at least
a name and a price.

There will be a flow to display and order products. These are the pages:

List view will list all the products in the store. The list of products has pagination and can be
sorted by price and alphabetically. Each product card has two actions: “add to cart” and “view”.
“view” will open the Detail view page.
Detail view is a page of the product where you can see details of the product and add the
product to the cart.
Shopping cart is the page where you can view the products in the cart, select quantity and view
the total price. Obviously, there is a button to place the order. To do so, you’ll need to also input
the name and address.

These are the pages for the back-office:

Login. Access to the back-office is done via the login page. Note: the user(s) credentials can be
hard-coded in the db.
Manage products with CRUD operations for the product
Orders is the page where you view all the orders placed on the site.
